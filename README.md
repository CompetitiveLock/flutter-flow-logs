# FlutterFlow Action Log Processor

## Overview

This project provides a script designed to process and summarize logs generated by **FlutterFlow**. The purpose of this tool is to accurately track and estimate project time by analyzing user actions within the FlutterFlow platform.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The script accepts a CSV file containing logs from FlutterFlow, which includes information such as the userâ€™s email, the action type (e.g., add, edit), timestamps, and whether the action was undone.
   
2. **Processing**: 
   - The script cleans the data by removing logs with missing user information or marked as "undo".
   - It then processes the logs chronologically for each user, detecting task repetitions based on time gaps or changes in the action type.
   - For each task, it calculates the total time spent and counts the number of occurrences.

3. **Output**:
   - A summarized version of the logs by day, user and type of activity.
